--music/basement_music--
meant to be played in the basement set piece, after the player gains control again and has to do stuff to get out of the basement

--music/ambience_gallery--
specific ambience loop for gallery/study section, only play when the player is in this area

--Sound Effects/Gallery SE/gallery_movepainting--
when the player interacts with one of the paintings, this plays, meant to alert the monster

--Sound Effects/Footsteps SE/creak01 to creak05--
creaks are meant to be played rarely, like say a 2% chance of it playing when the footstep sound is played
so when the random chance is triggered, one of the creak variations will be chosen and it will play at the same time as the footstep
hopefully 2% is not too frequent, can adjust accordingly if it's too often
